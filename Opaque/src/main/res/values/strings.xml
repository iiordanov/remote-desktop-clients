"In any Input Method, tap the keyboard icon to get the on-screen keyboard. Also, your device may have its own gesture which bring up the keyboard.

Use the Direct input modes for more intuitive touch-screen control. Use Simulated Touchpad Mode for finer control over the mouse.

Direct, Swipe Pan Method:
 - Control the mouse directly through touch.
 - Swipe to pan around.
 - Tapping makes the mouse click where you tapped.
 - Scroll events are sent between the two fingers where a two-finger swipe started.

Direct, Hold Pan Method:
 - Control the mouse directly through touch.
 - Long-tap to start pan mode.
 - Tapping makes the mouse click where you tapped.
 - Scroll events are sent between the two fingers where a two-finger swipe started.

Simulated Touchpad Method:
 - Use your screen like a touchpad.
 - Swipe to move the mouse pointer around.
 - Move mouse beyond edge of screen to pan.
 - Tapping makes the mouse click where the pointer is.
 - Scroll events are sent where the mouse pointer is located.

Single Handed Method:
 - Same as Direct, Swipe Pan Mode, except long-tap opens menu with choice of modes.
 - After choosing mode, swiping finger on screen performs selected gesture.
 - Lifting finger completes the gesture.

All Input Method:
 - Left-click: Tap once.
 - Double-click: Double-tap.
 - Right-click: Tap-hold and tap with a second finger (anywhere else on screen).
 - Alternate Right-click: Use the \"Back\" button or gesture for your device.
 - Middle-click: Tap-hold and tap with two more fingers (anywhere else on screen).
 - Mouse-drag: Tap-hold-long and swipe.
 - Scroll-wheel: Two-finger drag up/down and left/right. Quick drag scrolls faster.
 - Zoom in/out: Pinch-zoom to control scaling.
 - Ctrl/Alt key: Menu->Ctrl/Alt buttons. Don't forget to toggle off when done!
 - Key combos: Menu->More->Send Keys.
 - Send text: Either type on the on-screen keyboard, or use Menu->More->Send Text."
