1. Install sqlitegen plugin into Eclipse from:
      http://code.google.com/p/sqlitegen/

   NOTE: I've been told by a user that he had to "downgrade to"
         eclipse_site_0.1.16.

   NOTE: I found that with Eclipse 4.0 this tool no longer works.
         A fix or workaround is badly needed.

2. Clone the FreeRDP project in the parent directory of where you
   cloned bVNC project:
   git clone git://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP.git

   Check out a commit known to work with bVNC:
   git checkout dbbb34109824d9a9d8b3f4648183ce364e5aa0fc

   You should now have bVNC and FreeRDP side by side in the same
   directory.

   Add bVNC, ZoomerWithKeys and PubkeyGenerator from the
   bVNC/eclipse_projects/ directory to Eclipse as existing Android
   projects.
  
   Add FreeRDPCore from the FreeRDP/client/Android/ directory
   to Eclipse as an Existing Android Project.

3. Ensure ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, and FreeRDPCore projects
   are called exactly as written here by right-clicking 
   on each of them, then selecting Refactor->Rename

3. Add the ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, and FreeRDPCore projects
   as Library References to bVNC (right-click on the bVNC project
   and select Properties -> Android -> Library). If they are not,
   add them.

4. Ensure that ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, and FreeRDPCore 
   are specified as "Required projects on the build path" (right-
   click on the bVNC project, and select Properties -> Java Build
   Path -> Projects). If they are not, add them.

5. Ensure that ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, and FreeRDPCore
   are referenced in Properties -> Project References (put
   checkmarks on projects).

6. To build and successfully run aSPICE, you need to:
   - Install gstreamer-sdk into /opt/gstreamer
   - Edit AndroidManifest.xml and change android:label="bVNC" and android:name="bVNC"
     to android:label="aSPICE" and android:name="aSPICE" respectively.
   - cd bVNC/eclipse_projects/bVNC
   - Replace all instances of aSPICE with bVNC in native code (.c and .h files).
     This requirement should go away in the future. You can use the following command:
       find jni/src -name \*.h -o -name \*.c -exec sed -i 's/aSPICE/bVNC/' {} \;
   - ndk-build GSTREAMER_SDK_ROOT_ANDROID=/opt/gstreamer -j 4
   - Force one boolean variable to be true. You can use the following command:
       find ./ -name \*.java -exec sed -i 's/isSpice = .*;/isSpice = true;/' {} \;

Please inform me if (6) needs to be expanded (i.e. if you needed to do
anything else in addition to the above.
