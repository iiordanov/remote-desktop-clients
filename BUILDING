1. Install/update sqlitegen plugin v0.1.19 into Eclipse from:
   https://github.com/iiordanov/sqlitegen-secure/releases/download/v0.1.19/sqlitegen_eclipse_site_0.1.19.jar

   NOTE: Using an older version of the plugin may not work because
   of the switch to the sqlcipher release of sqlite.

2. Clone the FreeRDP project in the parent directory of where you
   cloned bVNC project:
   git clone git://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP.git

   Check out a commit known to work with bVNC:
   git checkout stable-1.1

   You should now have bVNC and FreeRDP side by side in the same
   directory.

   Add bVNC, ZoomerWithKeys and PubkeyGenerator from the
   bVNC/eclipse_projects/ directory to Eclipse as existing Android
   projects.
  
   Add FreeRDPCore from the FreeRDP/client/Android/ directory
   to Eclipse as an Existing Android Project.

3. Ensure ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, and FreeRDPCore projects
   are called exactly as written here by right-clicking 
   on each of them, then selecting Refactor->Rename

3. Add the ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, and FreeRDPCore projects
   as Library References to bVNC (right-click on the bVNC project
   and select Properties -> Android -> Library). If they are not,
   add them.

4. Ensure that ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, and FreeRDPCore 
   are specified as "Required projects on the build path" (right-
   click on the bVNC project, and select Properties -> Java Build
   Path -> Projects). If they are not, add them.

5. Ensure that ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, and FreeRDPCore
   are referenced in Properties -> Project References (put
   checkmarks on projects).

6. To build and successfully run aSPICE, you need to:
   - Install gstreamer-sdk into /opt/gstreamer

   - Edit AndroidManifest.xml and change android:label="bVNC" and android:name="bVNC"
     to android:label="aSPICE" and android:name="aSPICE" respectively.

   - cd bVNC/eclipse_projects/bVNC

   - Replace all instances of aSPICE with bVNC in native code (.c and .h files).
     This requirement should go away in the future. You can use the following command:
       find jni/src -name \*.h -o -name \*.c -exec sed -i 's/aSPICE/bVNC/' {} \;

   - ndk-build GSTREAMER_SDK_ROOT_ANDROID=/opt/gstreamer -j 4

   - Unfortunately, currently ndk-build destroys other pre-existing libraries in eclipse_projects/bVNC/libs,
     so after successfully building libspice and libgstreamer, one has to git checkout the files which were deleted.

   - Force one boolean variable to be true. You can use the following command:
       find ./ -name \*.java -exec sed -i 's/isSpice = .*;/isSpice = true;/' {} \;

   - You may have to select the "Android private libraries" entry in
       Project Properties->Java Build Path->Order and Export
     if you have it.

   - Enable requesting the RECORD_AUDIO permission in AndroidManifest.xml with the following sed command:
     sed -i 's/<!--RECORD_AUDIO-->/<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"><\/uses-permission>/g' AndroidManifest.xml

Please inform me if (6) needs to be expanded (i.e. if you needed to do
anything else in addition to the above.
